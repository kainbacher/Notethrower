oneloudr.com installation and usage guide
-----------------------------------------

+ code/filesystem setup:
	- copy the code to the desired location in the webserver
	- create the Includes/Config_local.php file by modifying the Config_local_default.php file and saving it as Config_local.php. this file should not be checked into the source code repository as it is specific for an installation.
	- make sure these directories exist and have 0777 permissions (all paths relative to the base directory of the installation):
		- Content/
		- Content/Tracks/
		- Content/UserImages/
		- Log/

+ DB setup:
    the DB can be created from scratch by executing these steps:
    	- create a MySQL database with utf8 encoding and utf8_unicode_ci collation
    	- configure the DB connection settings in Config_local.php
    	- execute the Install/dbsetup.php script
    	
    alternatively a DB dump from the live system can be imported, but it's important to also copy the complete contents of the Content/ folder to the new installation to have consistency between DB entries and files.

+ facebook login dummy:
	on development systems there is a facebook login dummy available: Site/fbDummy.php
	it shows a list of all available users and one can choose the user with which the login should be simulated.
