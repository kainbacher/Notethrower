config + git
--------------------------------------------------

there are two config files:

/Includes/Config.php
/Includes/Config_local.php

the Config_local.php file is not in the git repo - so use this file to set up the database connection and your local pathes. copy the Config_local_default.php to Config_local.php and change the variables. don't touch the Config_local_default.php.

also be careful with the Config.php - this file is on every machine the same.



Cron
--------------------------------------------------
In the "Doc" directory is the crontab.txt file which needs to be used to setup the cron jobs.
Use:
crontab <pathToSrc>/Doc/crontab.txt
To install the cron jobs.
Make sure that each job/shell script that is used in the jobs do have "world execute rights".



Shell scripts
--------------------------------------------------
Make sure that each job/shell script that is used in the jobs do have "world execute rights".
The files /Scripts/TranscodingJobProcessor(Test|Live).sh must have world execute rights (e.g. chmod a+x TranscodingJobProcessor(Test|Live.php) because cron starts that script.
