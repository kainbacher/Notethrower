3.	Licensing Fees and Payment

a.	Royalty-Free Licenses.  Notethrower incurs no obligation to pay royalties or make any other payments pursuant to the non-commerical use license and the linked agreement set forth in Section 2(a) or the adaptation license and the linked agreement set forth in Section 2(b).

b.	Commercial License Fees.  Notethrower will collect the Commercial License fees from Commercial Licensees pursuant to the Commercial Licensee Terms.  Notethrower will also collect any fees received pursuant to the optional donation option offered to users ("Optional User Fees").  Notethrower will deduct a fee of 10% from all fees received from Commercial Licensees and from Optional User Fees before paying the remainder of the fees received to Artist.  Provided, however, that in the case of a New Song, the fees will be divided evenly between Artist and the Remix Artist (45% to each).

If Notethrower determines in its commercially reasonable judgment that the offer is acceptable, it will forward it to Artist for approval or rejection.  If Artist does not respond within 48 hours of Notethrower forwarding the offer, then Notethrower will deem it accepted.

d.	Alteration of License Price.  Upon notice to the Artist, Notethrower may license the Song to a Commercial Licensee at a fee different from that requested by the Artist in the Notethrower-Artist Commercial Licensing Terms if it determines in its commercially reasonable judgment that such a fee is likely to produce a more beneficial result than the price originally proposed by the Artist.  Artist may alter the Notethrower-Artist Commercial Licensing Terms from time to time.

e.	Future Revenue Opportunities.  Notethrower anticipates that it may offer future revenue-generating services to Artist including, but not limited to, iTunes placements.  Unless otherwise specified and agreed, Notethrower will collect a 10% fee from such revenue from future activities.

f.	Payment Terms.  Within 30 days of the later of (a) the accumulation of $20 in fees or (b) the end of each calendar quarter, Notethrower will pay Artist all fees owed pursuant to Section 3(b).  Fees will be paid into the PayPal account specified in the Artist's user profile created upon signing up for the Notethrower service.  If no PayPal account is specified or if the PayPal account is invalid, Notethrower will hold payment until a valid account is provided, but not more than one year after receipt of the fees.

4.	Remixes.  By uploading the Song to the Notethrower Service, Artist makes it available and licenses it for the creation of Remixes.  In the event a Remix is created, the following terms in this Section 4 will apply.

a.	Ownership of New Master and New Composition.  The New Artist and Artist are joint authors of the New Master and New Composition and co-owners of the copyrights therein.  Any registration of the New Master or New Composition with any governmental copyright office, including, but not limited to the U.S. Copyright Office, or with any collecting society, including, but not limited to ASCAP, BMI, SESAC, or SoundExchange, shall acknowledge such joint authorship and co-ownership.

Artist acknowledges that the provisions of this Section 4 are intended to inure to the benefit of the New Artist as a third party beneficiary of this Agreement, and the New Artist will be entitled to enforce such provisions against Artist.
