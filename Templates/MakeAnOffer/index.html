3. Licensing Fees and Payment

b. Payment Terms. Any late payment will accrue interest at the lesser of the U.S. Prime Rate of interest plus 3% per month or the maximum interest allowable under applicable law. If Licensee fails to make payment, Licensee will be responsible for all reasonable expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by oneloudr in collecting such amounts. All payments due hereunder are in U.S. dollars and are exclusive of any applicable taxes, for which Licensee shall be responsible.
