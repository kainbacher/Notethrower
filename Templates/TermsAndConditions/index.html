<h2>Remix Agreement</h2>

<p>
This agreement ("Agreement") sets forth the terms under which Oneloudr authorizes you ("New Artist") to create a remixed version of an Original Master that has been posted on the Oneloudr service.  The Original Artist has licensed to Oneloudr certain rights with respect to the Original Song with the right to further sublicense rights to other artists, such as the New Artist.  For good and valuable consideration, the receipt of which is acknowledged, the parties agree as follows.
</p>

<p>
1.	Definitions
</p>

<p>
Media:  any recording or distribution medium, now existing or later developed in any format or version.
</p>

<p>
New Master:   the sound recording based on the Original Master created by New Artist by sampling, modifying, or adding instrumental or vocal tracks to the Original Master.
</p>

<p>
New Composition:  the musical composition that is a derivative version of the Original Composition and that is embodied in the New Master.
</p>

<p>
New Song:  collectively, the New Composition and the New Master.
</p>

<p>
Original Artist:  the author or authors of the Original Composition.
</p>

<p>
Original Composition:  the musical composition created by Original Artist and embodied in the Original Master.
</p>

<p>
Original Master:  a sound recording that (a) was created by Original Artist; and (b) posted on the Oneloudr Service by Original Artist; and (c) downloaded by New Artist for use pursuant to this Agreement.
</p>

<p>
Original Song:  collectively the Original Composition and Original Master.
</p>

<p>
2.	License
</p>

<p>
a.	Grant.  Oneloudr grants New Artist a non-exclusive and non-transferable right, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, to copy the Original Song as necessary for use under this Agreement and to create a single derivative work of the Original Song by modifying the Original Master through remixing, sampling, adding additional vocal or instrumental tracks, or otherwise changing it.
</p>

<p>
b.	Restrictions on Grant.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the intent of the license set forth in this Section is to facilitate the creation of a significantly modified work that recasts, transforms, adapts, or adds to the Original Composition.  Changes unlikely to be perceived as significant by listeners (by way of example, but not limited to, adding a few seconds of silence to the beginning or end of the track) violate the terms of the license set forth in this Section 2 and will thus result in New Artist gaining no rights pursuant to Section 3 of this Agreement.
</p>

<p>
3.	Intellectual Property Rights in New Song
</p>

<p>
a.	Ownership of New Master and New Composition.  The New Artist(s) and Artist are joint authors of each New Master and New Composition and co-owners of the copyrights therein.  Any registration of the New Master or New Composition with any governmental copyright office, including, but not limited to the U.S. Copyright Office, or with any collecting society, including, but not limited to ASCAP, BMI, SESAC, or SoundExchange, shall acknowledge such joint authorship and co-ownership.  The joint authorship will be attributed and acknowledged in connection with any publication of the New Song.
</p>

<p>
b.  Credits.  Artist and each New Artist will be entitled to revenues in proportion to their contribution to the New Song., with each such percentage portion of revenues considered a "Credit."  The contribution and Credit will be defined by the number of tracks contributed to the recording.  By way of example, and without limitation, an Artist may post a song and designate it as having two tracks, keyboards and vocals.  If a New Artist creates a New Song by adding an additional track to the foregoing song, then the New Song would consist of three tracks, with the Artist owning two credits in such song and the New Artist owning one credit.
</p>

<p>
c	Trademarks and Right of Publicity.  New Artist hereby grants Oneloudr and Original Artist a non-exclusive, assignable and sub-licensable license to reproduce and display New Artist's trademarks, service marks, logos, and any elements associated with the identity of New Artist including, but not limited to New Artist's name, likeness, or signature, for the purpose of identifying the New Artist or any portion thereof in connection with (a) the promotion and marketing of the New Song in any Media and  (b) the promotion of the Oneloudr website and business.
</p>

<p>
d.	Other Revenue.  In addition to and aside from the revenue division specified in this Agreement, and unless otherwise agreed by the New Artist and Artist, the New Artist agrees to pay the New Artist a portion of all gross income from commercial exploitation of the New Song in proportion to the Credits owned by New Artist in the New Song.  For the avoidance of doubt, Artist has agreed to a reciprocal obligation to New Artist pursuant to the Oneloudr Artist Agreement <LINK>, which is hereby incorporated by reference.  Unless otherwise agreed by the New Artist and Artist, each will bear its own expenses, taxes, and other costs associated with creating and exploiting the New Song.
</p>

<p>
e.	Further Exploitation of New Song.  The New Artist will reasonably cooperate with the Original Artist to exploit the New Song.  In any event, except as set forth in this Agreement, exploitation of the New Song, including, but not limited to securing publishing and performance royalties, is the mutual responsibility of New Artist and Artist and not Oneloudr.
</p>

<p>
f	Third Party Beneficiary.  NewArtist acknowledges that the provisions of this Section 3 are intended to inure to the benefit of the Original Artist as a third party beneficiary of this Agreement, and the Original Artist will be entitled to enforce such provisions against Artist.  New Artist further acknowledges that the Original Artist accepts its third party beneficiary rights hereunder and that such rights will be deemed irrevocable.
</p>

<p>
g.	Original Song.  For the avoidance of doubt, New Artist acknowledges that this Agreement grants New Artist no rights in, and creates no obligations with respect to, the Original Song or any derivative work based on the Original Song other than the rights needed to create and exploit the New Master and New Composition pursuant to this Agreement.
</p>

<p>
4.	 Exploitation of the New Song by Oneloudr
</p>

<p>
The Oneloudr Artist Agreement is hereby incorporated by reference.  The parties agree that the New Song created pursuant to this Agreement will be considered to be a Song as set forth in the Oneloudr Artist Agreement.  All rights, obligations, terms and conditions of the Oneloudr Artist Agreement that apply to Songs pursuant to the Oneloudr Artist Agreement will thus apply to the New Song created pursuant to this Agreement.

</p>

<p>
d.	Remedies.  With respect to any breach of warranty provided under this Section 5, New Artist shall at Oneloudr's option and request, in addition to any other remedy provided under this Agreement and at no additional cost to Oneloudr, replace or modify the New Song to correct any noncomformity.
</p>

<p>
6.	INDEMNIFICATION
</p>

<p>
a.	Indemnity.  New Artist agrees to defend, indemnify, and hold Oneloudr and the Original Artist harmless against any loss, cost, liability, and expense (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising from any breach of the representations and warranties set forth in Section 5.
</p>

<p>
b.	Settlement.  New Artist shall not, without the prior written consent of Oneloudr, settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim covered by the indemnity provided in this Section unless the settlement, compromise or consent provides for and includes an express, unconditional release of all claims, damages, liabilities, costs and expenses, including reasonable legal fees and expenses, against Oneloudr.
</p>

<p>
7.	NO CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
</p>
